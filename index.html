    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Games captured my imagination from an early age—how rules, visuals, and sound could intertwine to create something alive. These days, I like to craft small interactive experiences where players’ choices leave a mark, and where mechanics can surprise both the player and myself.<br> <br>

Since I started exploring game development in 2020, I’ve been learning by doing—tinkering with AI, testing dynamic gameplay ideas, and shaping worlds that didn’t exist before. Not every experiment worked, but each taught me something new, and the worlds that did come to life keep fueling my curiosity to push further.</h3>

      <h3>Rhythm Game (Unity)</h3>
      <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="project-video">
        <source src="assets/videos/rhythm-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <p>A timing-based rhythm game focused on input accuracy and synchronization with music. The project experiments with hit windows, feedback systems, and precise input handling to make each note feel satisfying. Through this, I learned how to balance difficulty, polish moment-to-moment gameplay, and design systems where even small mistakes feel intentional.</p>

    <div class="project-card fade-in">
      <h3>MusiCLI (Python)</h3>
      <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="project-video">

      </video>
      <p>A terminal-based music recommendation system that suggests tracks based on mood and text input. The project uses simple NLP techniques and rule-based logic to interpret user intent and generate recommendations. It was an experiment in combining programming with personal interests, focusing more on logic and interaction than flashy visuals.  </p>

      <h3>Voice Assistant for PWD (Python)</h3>
      <video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="project-video">

      </video>
      <p>An offline, terminal-driven voice assistant for people with disabilities designed for basic tasks like reminders, notes, and command execution. This project focuses on privacy-first design and local processing rather than cloud-based services. It helped me understand speech input pipelines, command parsing, and building usable tools with minimal interfaces.</p>

      <h3>First-Person Movement System (Unity)</h3>

      </video>
      <p>A custom first-person movement system built in Unity with a focus on responsiveness and player feel. This project explores grounded movement mechanics like acceleration, air control, jumping, and camera handling. I used it as a sandbox to understand how small changes in physics and input timing affect gameplay, and as a foundation for future action-focused games.</p>
